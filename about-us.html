	    <div class="content">
	      <p>The mission of the Millennium Nucleus on Young Exoplanets and their Moons (YEMS) is to promote research through interdisciplinary connections between astrophysics, planetary science, computer science, and engineering. This Center will be guided by the principles of openness and inclusiveness, putting diversity and accessibility at the forefront.

	      <h3>Expectations of YEMS members </h3>
	    </header>
	    <div class="content">
	      <p>At a basic level, YEMS members are expected to have a genuine passion and fascination with the scientific questions which drive the center. YEMS members are expected to recognize the importance of self-care, recognizing that our minds and bodies are our only real windows to the universe. YEMS members should support each other in this process and recognize the unique struggles every individual faces. YEMS members should respect and listen to one another. There are no bad ideas and our task is to identify the most promising research avenues. We recognize that creativity is the most important ability of a scientist and foster it through open discussions. However, we also recognize that creativity alone is wasted without investing the time and energy necessary to realize our ideas. We are willing to fail and take risks, acknowledging that not every venture can succeed but that this process is fundamental to scientific advances. YEMS members are expected to acknowledge the great importance of presenting results with a commitment to clarity, transparency and to nurture their own unique style of expression. YEMS members are encouraged to engage in public outreach and science communication in whatever form they prefer.
